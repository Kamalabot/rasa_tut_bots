# Created new story with just the active loop for form run
# Form has been defined, the entities has been defined
# intent for these entities are also defined, inside 'inform'
# question is whether the entities data created in inform intent 
# will be used here to extract columns
- story: highest country 
  steps:
  - intent: highest_in
  - action: high_form
  - active_loop: high_form
  - action: action_highest
#Initially I had not provided the action. At that time the bot started 
#looping, and went to action_default_fallback. Then experimenting with 
#action

#I had tried running the lowest country form inside the same story
#and the bot was confused after the lowest_in intent was triggered
#so seperating the story now

    #- story: lowest country
    #steps:
    #- intent: lowest_in
    #- action: low_form 
    #- active_loop: low_form 
    #- action: action_lowest  
#In all this, the actions.py script is kept as it is. Once the slots are 
#extracted the coded action are working
